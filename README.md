#Bivouac

An ultra-minimal webapp project setup. Uses Thomas Boyt's [More maintainable Gruntfiles](http://www.thomasboyt.com/2013/09/01/maintainable-grunt.html) approach to organizing tasks and options. Tasks and options based on the [Yeoman webapp generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp), and Patrick McKenna's [Travis CI generator](https://github.com/pwmckenna/generator-travis-ci).
